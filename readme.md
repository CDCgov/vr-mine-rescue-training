# VR-MRT
## Overview
VR-MRT is a training platform designed to supplement current mine rescue training. VR-MRT is intended to improve mine rescue team members' procedural, collaborative, and problem-solving skills for an underground emergency response. VR-MRT consists of five modules:

* Scenario Editor: Allows users to create, modify and share mine rescue scenarios. Using a desktop computer setup, users can place the objects in the scene, set up the ventilation, and change properties.
* Simulation Module: Allows users to work through the NIOSH provided or user created scenarios. Users will join using head mounted displays (HMDs) either remotely or co-located in the same space.
* Director Module: Allows the trainer to set up, record, monitor, and control the simulation. Using a desktop computer setup, the trainer can change users' settings (e.g., roles, handedness), load scenarios, move the team around the mine (i.e., teleport), and provide them with additional items.
* Spectator Module: Allows additional people to view what is going on in a simulation. Using a desktop computer setup, this module includes an overhead view as well as a chase camera view following the captain.
* Debrief Module: Allows users to play back the log file that was collected in the director module for an after-action review of the simulation.
